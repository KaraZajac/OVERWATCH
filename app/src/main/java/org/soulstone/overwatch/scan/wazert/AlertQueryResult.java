 * The result of one Waze RT area query: the alerts the server added (as
 * AddAlertAction elements) and the uuids it removed (as "RmAlert," old_command
 * lines).
 *
 * The RT /command endpoint is session-stateful, it only sends an alert once per
 * session, then a removal when it clears, so callers must MERGE these deltas into
 * a persistent cache rather than treat each result as a full snapshot. See
 * {@link WazeAlertCache}.
